# BPHAnalysis

## Running in docker

If you don't have docker installed already, instructions are [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

For a more recent CMSSW release like CMSSW_9_4_4, run a docker image:

`
docker run --name bph -it clelange/cmssw:9_4_4 /bin/bash
`

where we use the already-made CMSSW_9_4_4 release from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/clelange/cmssw/tags)

Note: as described [here](https://github.com/clelange/cmssw-docker/) this will install a stand-alone CMSSW image so it will be
at least a few GBs and may take a while (but only has to be done once).

Once done, you should see the commmand prompt (`docker run -i` means run interactively):

`
cmsbld@3eebec38509d ~/CMSSW_9_4_4/src $
`

Then clone this repository :

```
cmsbld@3eebec38509d ~/CMSSW_9_4_4/src $ git clone https://github.com/tpmccauley/BPHAnalysis.git

You can exit the container and get back to your original command prompt:

`
cmsbld@3eebec38509d ~/CMSSW_9_4_4/src $ exit
`

To check the status of the container:

`
docker ps -a
`

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES

```

To start the container again and continue your work:

`
docker start -i bph
`

which will restart your container

```
cmsbld@3eebec38509d ~/CMSSW_9_4_4/src $ ls
BPHAnalysis
```
